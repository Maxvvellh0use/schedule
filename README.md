# schedule 

### Determining user needs

#### Comparing two types of schedule: [current schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oM2O8DtjC0HodB3j7hcIResaWBw8P18tXkOl1ymelvE/) and [schdeule in rs app](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app)

| Schedule type           | Advantages                                              | Disadvantages  |
| ----------------        | -----------------------------------------------         | -----------    |
| RS App schedule         | <ul><li>all information is consolidated in one place</li><li>balanced appearance</li><li>integration to App</li><li>type of task is easyly determined</li></ul>                                                                | <ul><li>Incomplete schedule</li><li>No weeks separating</li><li>no explicit highlighting of the important</li></ul>                                                                              |

#### Concept of perfect schedule according to survey (marked implemented ideas): 

- [ ] the student can mark the importance of the schedule items for himself / herself
- [ ] the student can mark the completed and unfulfilled items of the schedule
- [ ] the student can evaluate the assignment right on the schedule page according to the criteria of its usefulness, comprehensibility, quality of presentation of the material
- [ ] part of the schedule that is already in the past is automatically hidden, only the present and future are displayed
- [x] you can specify various additional materials to the topic (many. 10-20 points)
- [x] the task page is not a separate page on the Internet, but a part of the schedule that opens and hides on click
- [x] For long-term events possibility to see the duration (how many days there are before the deadline) - as a separate field or some kind of beautiful link with the deadline event.
- [ ] For graded assignments, points and coefficients for the assignment are displayed, for completed and verified assignments - how many points could be received and how many were received by the student who views the schedule
- [ ] Display only the current schedule for the week when the student marked its completion, show the next part of the schedule
- [ ] Students on the schedule page can vote for the events they find most useful. Each event displays its rating
for assessed tasks, you need to display the number of points for the task in order to understand what you lose if it is not completed
- [ ] It should be nice and cool. The timetable is the face of the course. Just let it be a table with cells at school, and on the frontend course and the schedule should be high-tech. Each task can be done as a level in the game. Completed the task - passed the level. A course project as the final boss
Each new set contains part of the tasks from the previous schedule. It should be possible to copy the schedule of one set, add it to another set, and make changes. If for each new set you need to create a new schedule from scratch, no one will use this application
